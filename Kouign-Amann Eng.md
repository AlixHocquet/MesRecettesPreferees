## Ingredients
### *For 6 people* 
* 15g **baker's yeast**
* 20cl **warm water**
* 200g **butter** with half a teaspoon of **salt**
* 300g **flour**
* 10g **melted butter**
* 200g **caster sugar**

## Preparation 
1. Dissolve the yeast in 20cl of lukewarm water. Leave the butter to soften at room temperature.
2. Sift the flour into a fountain in a bowl, place the dissolved yeast and melted butter in the centre, then mix for around ten minutes until the dough is soft and smooth. Cover with a cloth and leave it to double in size for about 1 hour in a warm place.
3. Roll out the dough into a large pancake. Spread the softened butter over it, leaving a 2cm margin around the edge and pour in the caster sugar to cover the butter. Fold the pancake over to form a triangle.
4. Preheat the oven to 200°C (gas mark 6-7).
5. Leave the dough to rest for a few minutes, then roll it out again. Fold it into quarters and roll out into a long rectangle. Roll up the dough like a snail, then flatten it by hand into a circular shape about 22 cm in diameter.
6. Brush a cake tin generously with butter, then sprinkle with caster sugar. Tap the sugar into the mould, turning it to distribute it evenly.
7. Place the pastry in the mould.
8. Place in the oven and bake for 30 minutes, covering the cake with aluminium foil at the end if the surface browns too quickly.
9. Take it out the mould warm and serve it lukewarm.
